# üçÖ Tomato Plant Disease Detection using InceptionV3 & TensorFlow
This project aims to detect and classify **10 different tomato plant leaf conditions** (including healthy and diseased leaves) using **deep learning**. It leverages **TensorFlow**, **InceptionV3**, and **ImageDataGenerator** to build a high-accuracy image classification model. The goal is to assist farmers and agricultural experts in **early identification of tomato plant diseases**, leading to more effective treatments and improved crop yields.

## ‚úÖ Disease Classes
The model is trained on 10 distinct classes:

1. Tomato\_Bacterial\_spot
2. Tomato\_Early\_blight
3. Tomato\_healthy
4. Tomato\_Late\_blight
5. Tomato\_Leaf\_Mold
6. Tomato\_Septoria\_leaf\_spot
7. Tomato\_Spider\_mites (Two-spotted spider mite)
8. Tomato\_Target\_Spot
9. Tomato\_Yellow\_Leaf\_Curl\_Virus
10. Tomato\_mosaic\_virus

### üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

The dataset was sourced from the **PlantVillage** dataset, a well-known public dataset for plant disease detection. Images are labeled by experts and cover a wide variety of disease symptoms under different lighting and angle conditions.
